## Biography

As a Full Stack Developer with a background in Biomedical Engineering, I have applied my interdisciplinary skills and knowledge in research, analytics, data management, software development, web/mobile applications, DevOps, SaaS/PaaS, and cloud computing to create innovative solutions for a variety of projects across a breadth of frameworks and services. I have years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, working with multiple programming languages, development frameworks, and cloud infrastructures. I have developed OSS & PaaS for R programmers and R/Shiny developers, including user authentication and web app hosting, as well as web applications for clients from diverse professional fields. I have also handled the application development life-cycle, database, server, and API creation/maintenance, and automated tasks for both web & mobile applications & solutions, for both internal use and client needs. I am a quick learner with a passion for always improving upon my existing knowledge and skills, as well as learning new ones. I have experience in working autonomously, one-on-one, and as a group, with colleagues, clients, and third-party members.
