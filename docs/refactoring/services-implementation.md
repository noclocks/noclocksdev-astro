# Services Pages Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the services section on the No Clocks, LLC website.

## Overview

The services section consists of:
1. A main services overview page (`/services`)
2. Individual service detail pages for each core service
3. Reusable components that display service information

## Page Structure

### Main Services Page (`/services.astro`)

The main services page provides an overview of all services offered by No Clocks, LLC. It includes:

- A hero section with a title and subtitle
- An introduction to our services
- A grid of service cards, each linking to a detailed service page
- An "Our Approach" section explaining our service delivery methodology
- A call-to-action component encouraging visitors to contact us

### Individual Service Pages

Each service has its own dedicated page with detailed information:

1. **Software Engineering** (`/services/software-engineering.astro`)
2. **Cloud Computing** (`/services/cloud-computing.astro`)
3. **AI Solutions** (`/services/ai-solutions.astro`)
4. **Data Engineering** (`/services/data-engineering.astro`)
5. **E-commerce Solutions** (`/services/ecommerce.astro`)
6. **Web & Mobile Development** (`/services/web-mobile.astro`)

Each service page uses the `ServiceDetails.astro` component to maintain consistent layout and styling.

## Components

### ServiceDetails Component

The `ServiceDetails.astro` component is used in all individual service pages and provides a consistent template with:

- Service title and subtitle
- Feature image
- Detailed description
- Key features in a grid layout
- Case studies (if available)

Props:
- `title`: The name of the service
- `subtitle`: A brief tagline for the service
- `description`: Detailed HTML description
- `imageSrc`: Path to the service's featured image
- `imageAlt`: Alt text for the image
- `features`: Array of feature objects with title, description, and optional icon
- `caseStudies`: Array of case study objects with title and description

### ServiceGrid Component

The `ServiceGrid.astro` component displays all services in a grid layout on the main services page. Each service card includes:

- Service icon
- Title
- Brief description
- Link to the detailed service page
- Background image

The component is self-contained with its own data array of services.

### ServicesHighlight Component

The `ServicesHighlight.astro` component is used on the homepage to showcase a subset of our services. It can be limited to display only the most important services using the optional `limit` prop.

## Images

Service images are stored in `/public/images/services/` with the following naming convention:
- `software-engineering.jpg`
- `cloud-computing.jpg`
- `ai-solutions.jpg`
- `data-engineering.jpg`
- `ecommerce.jpg`
- `web-mobile.jpg`

The hero image for the services page is stored in `/public/images/heroes/services-hero.jpg`.

## Styling

All service pages follow the site's global styling while maintaining their unique visual identity. The design uses:

- A consistent color palette following the No Clocks brand guidelines
- Responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Subtle animations and hover effects to enhance user experience
- Proper spacing and typography to ensure readability

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the services section include:

1. Adding more detailed case studies with metrics and testimonials
2. Implementing a filtering system to help users find relevant services
3. Creating an FAQ section for each service
4. Adding integration with a CMS to make service updates easier
5. Implementing schema.org markup for better SEO
